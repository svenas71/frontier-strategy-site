> ### "As you start to walk on the way, the way appears." – Rumi
 ### Clarity doesn't come before action.   
 ### It comes from action.



This single line by Rumi has been the most influential tidbit of ancient wisdom I have read. 
Influential in the most immediate sense, in that after reading it, I started Frontier Signals - which then grew to Frontier Strategy. 

With this site, I am beginning my walk. 

With Frontier Strategy my goal is to engage with people who are on a similar path: keen on biology, health, data and science  —  and who use this knowledge to bring real solutions to our society.  

These solutions can have many '*modalities*': a scientific paper, a collaboration, a product, a venture or a grant. Or a *new modality* altogether. We are about innovation after all.


In the coming weeks, more will appear here:
	•	**Frontier Signals** → observational pieces from the edge of science & venture.
	•	**Frontier Services** → concrete, bookable time to help you on your own path.
	•	**Frontier Domains** → my catalog of experiences and use cases, showing where I’ve been, and where we might go together.



The way doesn’t appear all at once. But it will appear — step by step.
