## Vision

Science is advancing faster than ever — microbiome research, personalised medicine, quantum biology, and data-driven discovery are opening up new frontiers. Yet, the complexity of these fields often slows translation into outcomes.

My mission is to help innovators not just make discoveries, but to turn them into sustainable businesses with lasting societal impact.

	•	Translate complex biology into clear commercial strategies
	•	Build global partnerships across academia, biotech, and pharma
	•	Secure funding through grant strategy and proposal development
	•	Develop ventures from early science to market impact

## Who I Am
