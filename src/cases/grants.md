## Outcomes
- Established the **first dedicated forum** on computational chromatin dynamics.  
- Connected researchers from previously separate communities.  
- Sparked ongoing collaborations (UK, US, Japan, EU).  
- Positioned the UK as a visible hub in this emerging field.  

## Why it mattered
Understanding chromatin dynamics is a frontier problem: megabase-scale DNA, 200+ proteins, and rapid biophysical change. Only by combining modelling with cutting-edge experiments can we approach a causal understanding of gene regulation.  

This meeting catalyzed the community shift toward integrated models — laying groundwork for tools, collaborations, and future grants.  

### Rationale & Motivation
The structure of chromatin has been notoriously difficult to determine. Composed of megabases of DNA and more than 200 known different proteins, our understanding of the exact dimensions, composition, biophysics and dynamics have changed dramatically over the years. Now that we are able to determine the structure of whole genomes, and combine this information with the increasing wealth of genome-wide epigenetic and gene expression data, we are beginning to see how the 3D structure of the entire genome has implications for regulation of gene expression and cellular development. Similarily, we are beginning to see how genome structure is being shaped by cellular events. In essence, gene regulatory events are accompanied, or even brought about by, changes in genome architecture.
This meeting will bring together computational and experimental researchers at the forefront of the chromatin field, with the aim to understand where the current boundaries of our understanding exactly lie. Computational models of chromatin need to be able to incorporate the latest data and be informed of current experimental approaches. And experimentists are eager to understand to what degree precisely models can help their research, experimentally and conceptually. Bringing these two approaches together is currently not done in other meetings, which is our motivation to host this conference. 
Being able to understand chromatin dynamics quantitatively will impact our understanding of gene regulation, cellular development and many disease phenotypes.
