Securing competitive funding is one of the biggest hurdles for research teams and ventures. Success depends not only on the science, but also on how well the science is presented, positioned, and aligned with funding priorities.

**My Experience**
I bring deep experience from both sides of the table. As a long-time evaluator for the European Research Area (ERA), I have reviewed over 100 proposals, including:
	•	Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (individual fellowships and mobility schemes).
	•	International Training Networks (consortia budgets ranging from €200k to €3M).
	•	Early-stage collaborative projects at the intersection of academia and industry.


In addition, I have written and co-authored several successful grant applications myself, winning competitive funding from the BBSRC, MRC, Prime-XS (EU-FP7), and the Royal Society London, with a total value of over £4 million.


This experience gives me a clear sense of what evaluators look for, and where many proposals fall short.

**How I Can Help**
	•	Strategic fit: Identify the right calls and align your proposal with funding body expectations.
	•	Narrative clarity: Translate complex science into a compelling, funder-ready proposals.
	•	Review & strengthen: Identify weaknesses, reframe objectives, and highlight impact.
	•	End-to-end support: From idea to submission, or targeted interventions where you need them most.

**Outcome**
A higher chance of success, a stronger narrative, and the confidence that your proposal speaks directly to reviewers and funders.
