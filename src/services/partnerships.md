**My Experience**
Throughout my career I’ve worked in collaborations that spanned labs, institutions, and industries — from international genomics consortia at Cambridge and Babraham, to partnerships with pharma and biotech while at Eagle Genomics, to innovation networks like the Milner Therapeutics Institute.

What I’ve learned is simple: **the right partnership can accelerate everything**. Knowing where to look, who to trust, and how to frame the collaboration makes the difference.

**That’s what I help with**
	•	Map potential partner landscapes across pharma, biotech, and health tech.	
	•	Facilitate introductions and frame collaborations so they start on strong terms.
	•	Bring an insider’s perspective on how to align science, strategy, and culture for lasting value.
	•	Draw on experience building partnerships at Eagle Genomics and in international consortia.
