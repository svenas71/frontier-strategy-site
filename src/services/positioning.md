**My Experience**
I trained and worked at Oxford, Cambridge, and the MRC-LMB — institutions where scientific discovery is prized.

Later, at Eagle Genomics and as an innovation scout for the Milner Therapeutics Institute, I saw how breakthroughs can succeed — or stall — when they meet investors, pharma scouts, and advisory boards.

One lesson stood out: **positioning matters**. Brilliant science alone isn’t enough — it must be framed so the right people see its potential.

**That’s what I help with**
	•	Shape your scientific narrative into an investor-ready story.
	•	Position your company at the intersection of biology, data, and venture.
	•	Ensure your breakthrough doesn’t get lost in translation.
